# Neurosis - Verdun 1916

I was 15, and I was searching for new sounds to explore, one of the metal heads of my classroom borrow me Verdun 1916, at that time for me Neurosis was a little heavier than I used to hear but this album connects me immediately.

Voice, guitars, and letters are so fucking amazing that was impossible not to enjoy the entire album, now I have 3 different copies of this album, a remastered edition from the original album from 2020, a Viuda Negra edition with a bonus song, and the third one is an edition with such a great linear note a deluxe edition with two bonus tracks, I feel very proud because two of these editions are signed by Jorge Mackenzie, and are some jewels of my collection and definitively of Colombian Metal history.

This album got songs in Spanish and English, first part of the album are songs in English, starts with The Eyes of the Souls with a melodic guitar and from one moment to another a piercing screaming that follows the entire song with such a great rhythm, at the middle of the song combines different components that show the concept behind the composition of the song, then continues with Politicians a very straight message to a problem that fucks up our Colombian society longer than I would like to accept, once again the song mix different times, structures, and sounds that create a perfect ambient for the message.

The third song of the album is Military Sacrifice, is a great trash song, with a lot of changes in his structure, within a changing riff during the entire song, then Deprived of Liberty is a gesture of virtuosity of the entire band, an instrumental song full of different tints. Full of Thorns and Bautizados en Rencor are great songs but I need to admit that are my least favorites of the album, in some way I hear it more linear than the other songs on the album.

At this point starts the song in Spanish with Verdun 1916, such a jewel, the guitar intro is amazing, the transition between the intro and the song is brutal, the entire bass and how to construct the melody within the song, the transitions of riff and different changes, and the awesome voice + letters convert this song in a hymn.

Involucion for me was an inspiration in my time as poet-writer for his letters and deepness, also love how the voice do the changes between a pretty stable riff withing the song, Intro (El lamento) is just a perfect middle for the album just to introduce another hymn of Neurosis, El paso del tiempo no cura in music and voice is a song full of emotions and passion, I really love the guitar in Marea Negra most of all the solo of the intro and how is integrated within the main riff, the last song in the original record is Convencion Ancestral, such a strong song, very compact, pure speed trash song for a 'mosh'.

In the Green Revolution version of the Verdun are included La Profecia and Invencible, two songs recorded with Bull Metal, a pretty raw records that allows feeling the beginning of the entire band, in the other hand the other bonus record is The White Man a live song recorded with the lineup of this album, is a really trashy song that shows the essence at stage of that era of Neurosis.

Verdun 1916 is just a foundation for all the history of the Colombian Metal.
