# 1280 Almas - La 22

There is a lot of feelings about this album, I remember that i already loved "las almas" but I ain't got any cd at that time, and in the store that i was used to buy my CDs, La 22 arrives .. . and was the perfect time to buy it. Maybe that weekend in a local station was the review of that album, and was just great commentaries, I just heard it all the time, and in that way became part of my soundtrack, of everyday, of my life.

Is just a timeless album, their lyrics are about the reality of Colombia, is about 24 years since this album was published, and the situation is basically the same. La 22 is just passion, reflection, insurrection, acommpanied by a great bass as always from "el gordo", great drums, a guitar that gives the strenght at every song, the voice of Fernando as always great, for me, La 22 is the best album of 1280 Almas.

La 22 is the essence of the 90's rock in Bogotá, is a narration of the colombian reality, is a mix of emotions in a rollercoaster that sumarize how Colombia looks like through the time.

Creo que podria decir mucho más sobre este album en español, pero espero que los reviews de la música en español sea vista por personas que no entienden lo que dicen las letras pero puedan entender un poco de cada trabajo hecho por tantas increibles bandas en nuestra región.

Solo puedo decir gracias a las almas por ser parte de mi vida y ser la esencia del rock en Bogotá.

# "Worst Song"

All the entire album is just a masterpiece, but I don't totally like Viene la Banda, is a good song, but for me is not at the same level of the other songs of the album. Is like if that song doesn't totally fit into the album.
